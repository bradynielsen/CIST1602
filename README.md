# CIST1602
Policies and Procedures Courseware

This is where students in CIST1602 Policies and Procedures will collaborate and store student-generated content.

Our objective is to learn how to use Git and Github, build content in a course without any exciting technology, and hopefully we can replace an expensive textbook with open educational resources (OER).  This will not be a quick process, but rather an iterative process.

Enjoy!
